''' A school decided to replace the desk in three classrooms. Each desk sits two students.
Given the number of students in each class, print the smallest possible number of desks that can be purchased.
the  program should read three integers: the number of students in each of the three classes, a,b and c respectively.
in the first test there are three groups. the first group hs 20 students and thus need 10 desks.
the second group has 21 students. we need 32 desk in total.
